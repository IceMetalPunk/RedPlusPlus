# RedPlusPlus
An update of Red+, this Minecraft 1.12 mod adds new redstone items into the game.

## Features:
### New Blocks & Items:
| Feature  | Description | To Unlock Recipe... |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Redstone Counter | Right-click to cycle through numbers 0-15; emits a redstone signal equal to its displayed number. | Obtain a comparator |
| Analog Lamp | Emits light with brightness equal to its highest redstone input. | Obtain Nether quartz |
| Redstone Wrench | Right-click a directional block with this to rotate it so it faces where you clicked. If you click the front of a block, it will flip to face the opposite direction. | Obtain redstone |
| Golden Button | Produces a 1-redstone-tick (2-game-tick) redstone output when pressed. Can be pressed repeatedly and quickly by holding right-click/Use Item button. | Obtain a gold nugget |
| Player Pressure Plate | A pressure plate that can only be activated by players. | Obtain a diamond |
| Redstone Meter | Right-click any block with this to get its indirect power level. Useful for debugging redstone devices. | Obtain a Redstone Wrench |
| Trapped Shulker Boxes | Just like a shulker box, but emit redstone when opened like a trapped chest. Strength is equal to the number of players looking in the box; will power strongly through the block it's attached to, weakly in the other 5 directions. | Obtain a purple shulker box and a comparator (not necessarily at the same time) |
| Heavy and Light Smart Plates | Act like heavy and light pressure plates, but count individual items in a stack rather than counting item stacks as a single entity | Obtain a comparator |
| Secret stuff... | It's a secret! | Two can be unlocked in secret ways; one you must craft on your own, without Recipe Book help ;) |

### Tweaks:
- Lava pushes mobs like water; great for Nether farm transport.
- Dispensers will plant crops/seeds/saplings if faced into a suitable planting block (dirt, farmland, soul sand, etc. depending on crop)
- Dispensers with wrenches will rotate the block they face around the axis they face.
- Dispensers will place gravity blocks in the world (sand, gravel, anvils, concrete powder, etc.)
